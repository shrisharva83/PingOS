###Ping RTOS

### Abstract
This project focuses on developing a real-time operating system (RTOS) kernel for ARM Cortex-M4 based processors. The kernel enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks using a priority-based scheduler. To prevent race conditions during resource sharing, synchronization mechanisms such as semaphores and mutexes have been implemented. A two-player interactive Ping Pong game running on a Nokia 5110 LCD demonstrates the system’s multitasking and resource management capabilities.

### Completed Work
- Implemented a hard real-time OS with a preemptive, priority-based scheduler.  
- Designed the scheduling algorithm with O(1) time complexity for efficient task switching.  
- Incorporated synchronization primitives including semaphores and mutexes.  
- Developed a Ping Pong demo game to showcase real-time multitasking on embedded hardware.
